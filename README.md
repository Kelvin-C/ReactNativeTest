## Setup
Ensure you have npm install on your machine. Then, go to the root of this repository and run `npm install` to install all the necessary libraries to run the application.

## How to run
This requires an emulator to be ran. Here's an example using Android Studio's emulator.

Now that we have an Android emulator running, go back to the project. Run `npm run android` to start the application on the running Android emulator.
